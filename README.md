# LockerGnome Support

We use GitHub for organizing and managing support issues (both bug & feature requests). This helps us keep track of things, provide progress, and allow the community to contribute to providing solutions.

You can:

1. **[Click here to open a new issue if you run into a bug / problem on LockerGnome.net](https://github.com/lockergnome/support/issues)**
2. **[Click here to propose a new feature (or iteration on an existing feature)](https://github.com/lockergnome/support/discussions)**

When creating an issue, please provide as much detail as possible, including:
- A clear and descriptive title.
- Steps to reproduce the bug.
- Expected behavior vs. actual behavior.
- Screenshots or screen recordings, if applicable.
- Your operating system and browser version.

### Private Support

If you have a sensitive issue that requires private communication, such as a security concern or a billing question, please email us at **support@lockergnome.com**.
